Creates a simple Netlify website that redirects links to videos posted on the "Knowledge Miner" account on Bilibili (kindly administered by [@fuerzhou](https://github.com/fuerzhou)). The site is set up so that:

- https://bilibili.djnavarro.net goes to the Knowledge Miner homepage
- https://bilibili.djnavarro.net/project-structure goes to the Project Structure series
- https://bilibili.djnavarro.net/installing-r goes to the Installing R series
- etc
